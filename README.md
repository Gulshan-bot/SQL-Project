Snitch Fashion Sales Analysis - SQL Database Project
Developed a comprehensive retail analytics database system for Snitch Clothing Sales using MySQL to analyze customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and revenue trends. The project encompasses end-to-end database design, including schema creation with relational integrity constraints, data importation, and execution of 25+ complex SQL queries spanning basic retrieval to advanced analytics.
The database architecture consists of three normalized tables (Products, Customers, Orders) with proper foreign key relationships, enabling multi-dimensional analysis of sales patterns, customer segmentation, and product profitability metrics.
