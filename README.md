# SQL-Project
Snitch Fashion Sales Analysis - SQL Database Project
Developed a comprehensive retail analytics database system for Snitch Clothing Sales using MySQL to analyze customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and revenue trends. The project encompasses end-to-end database design, including schema creation with relational integrity constraints, data importation, and execution of 25+ complex SQL queries spanning basic retrieval to advanced analytics.
The database architecture consists of three normalized tables (Products, Customers, Orders) with proper foreign key relationships, enabling multi-dimensional analysis of sales patterns, customer segmentation, and product profitability metrics.

Technical Implementation:

>  Designed and implemented a normalized relational database with 3 tables (Products, Customers, Orders) using MySQL, incorporating primary and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity
>  Executed 25+ SQL queries ranging from basic CRUD operations to complex multi-table JOINs, aggregate functions, and subqueries for comprehensive sales analysis
>  Performed data analysis using advanced SQL techniques including GROUP BY, HAVING clauses, CASE statements, and window functions to derive actionable business insights

Business Analytics & Insights:

>  Analyzed customer purchasing patterns across demographics (age, gender, city) to identify high-value customer segments and optimize marketing strategies
>  Generated revenue analysis reports by product category, customer segments, and geographic regions, revealing key profitability drivers
>  Identified top-performing products and categories by units sold and revenue generation, providing data-driven recommendations for inventory management
>  Conducted cohort analysis using age group segmentation (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+) to understand spending patterns across different demographics

Key Achievements/Findings:

>  Calculated total revenue metrics and identified top 5 customers contributing maximum revenue for targeted retention programs
